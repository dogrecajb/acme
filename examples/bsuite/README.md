# Acme agents on bsuite

This folder contains several examples of how to run `Acme` agents on
[`bsuite`](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite) , the "Behaviour Suite for
Reinforcement Learning".

`bsuite` is a collection of carefully-designed experiments that investigate core
capabilities of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent with two main objectives:

1. To collect clear, informative and scalable problems that capture key issues
   in the design of efficient and general learning algorithms.
2. To study agent behavior through their performance on these shared benchmarks.

For more information see https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite, and the
accompanying paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03568.
